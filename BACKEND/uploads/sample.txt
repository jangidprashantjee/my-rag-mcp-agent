The Zephyrus-9X prototype drone was tested successfully on June 14, 2025, at the internal test facility in Manesar. It achieved a flight duration of 87 minutes on a single charge, outperforming all previous iterations. The team led by Dr. Kavya Rajan implemented a new hybrid propulsion mechanism, combining electric rotors with a micro-gas turbine booster. The firmware version used during the test was v2.6.14-alpha. A total of 12 engineers contributed to the prototype, and the next review meeting is scheduled for August 12, 2025.
